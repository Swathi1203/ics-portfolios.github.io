    "summary": "I am a student studying Computer Science & Social Work at the University of Hawaii at Manoa. I was always interested in CS and after taking courses in Social Work, I realized how much difference a good and user-friendly software can be when it comes to case management and working with marginalized populations. It was then I decided that I should tie in both of my passions -- CS and helping others."
