## Advisor update email

Greetings Gerald and Galen,

Could you please send out the following to the ICS and CE undergrad mailing lists?

Greetings, students,

Twice a year, I update the Professional Portfolio website at https://ics-portfolios.github.io/.  Currently, over 350 portfolios from ICS and Computer Engineering are listed at this site.  I am writing to nudge you to review your professional portfolio and update it (or create it!) if necessary.

Developing and maintaining a professional portfolio is one of the best things you can do to improve your job prospects after graduation.  I have had many students tell me that they thought their professional portfolio was a key factor in receiving a job offer.

If you already have a professional portfolio, it won't take much time to bring it up to date. I suggest the following:

  1. In bio.json, review your interests, and update them if they've changed.
  2. In bio.json, review your summary statement, and update it if necessary. Make sure your expected grad date is accurate.
  3. Look at the remainder of the bio.json, and see if you have any new jobs or awards to include.
  4. Check your projects page. Can you update any of the existing projects with new info? Have you worked on anything that you can now include?

This will normally take you less than 30 minutes. By reviewing your portfolio once or twice a year and making sure it's current, you'll be ready to send a recruiter or graduate school the URL at a moment's notice.

If you don't have a professional portfolio, and would like one, I recommend you consider http://techfolios.github.io/, the template system used to generate the vast majority of the portfolios on this site. Feel free to email me (johnson@hawaii.edu) if you have any questions, or just ask any student who took ICS 314 during the last few years.

If you want your portfolio removed from the ics-portfolios site, just email me (johnson@hawaii.edu) and I'll remove it.  However, before you do that, consider the following: (1) Listing your portfolio may lead to interesting professional opportunities; (2) Your listing provides valuable insight into the ICS and CE programs for the local community, which could help our departments improve in future; (3) Your listing of interests helps our departments understand what areas students wish to learn about, which informs curriculum decisions.  That said, the choice is yours.

Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions.
