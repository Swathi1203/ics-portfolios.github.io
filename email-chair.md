Hi Scott and Guylaine,

I've just done my twice-yearly update to the ICS Portfolios site to include new students:

https://ics-portfolios.github.io/

Some statistics:

- 353 total portfolios (238 undergrads, 8 grads, 5 faculty, and 102 alumni)
- For current undergrads, the top 5 interest areas are:

  1. Software Engineering (148)
  2. Artificial Intelligence (93)
  3. Games and game development (55)
  4. Security (53)
  5. Web development (42)
